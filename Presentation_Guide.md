## SLIDE 8: METHODOLOGY - ML ALGORITHMS
### Core Algorithms with Code Examples

**1. Cosine Similarity** (Primary metric - 45% weight)
```python
# L2 Normalization + Cosine Similarity
user1_norm = np.linalg.norm(user1_vector)
user2_norm = np.linalg.norm(user2_vector)
user1_normalized = user1_vector / (user1_norm + 1e-8)
user2_normalized = user2_vector / (user2_norm + 1e-8)

from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
audio_similarity = cosine_similarity([user1_normalized], [user2_normalized])[0][0]
```

**2. Jaccard Similarity** (Artist overlap - 35% weight)
```python
def calculate_artist_overlap(user1_data, user2_data):
    user1_artists = set(user1_data.get('top_artists', []))
    user2_artists = set(user2_data.get('top_artists', []))

    intersection = len(user1_artists.intersection(user2_artists))
    union = len(user1_artists.union(user2_artists))

    return intersection / union if union > 0 else 0.0
```

**3. Jensen-Shannon Divergence** (Genre similarity - 20% weight)
```python
from scipy.spatial.distance import jensenshannon

def calculate_genre_similarity(user1_data, user2_data):
    # Convert genre distributions to probability vectors
    user1_genres = normalize_genre_distribution(user1_data['genres'])
    user2_genres = normalize_genre_distribution(user2_data['genres'])

    js_distance = jensenshannon(user1_genres, user2_genres)
    return 1 - js_distance  # Convert distance to similarity
```

### Enhanced Compatibility Formula
```python
# Weighted combination of all similarity metrics
def calculate_enhanced_compatibility(audio_sim, artist_overlap, genre_sim):
    enhanced_compatibility = (
        audio_sim * 0.45 +      # Audio features (45% weight)
        artist_overlap * 0.35 + # Artist overlap (35% weight)
        genre_sim * 0.20        # Genre similarity (20% weight)
    )

    # Twin classification
    are_twins = enhanced_compatibility >= 0.8

    return enhanced_compatibility, are_twins
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
```
Final Score = (Audio × 0.45) + (Artists × 0.35) + (Genres × 0.20)
```

- **Impact**: Algorithm couldn't distinguish compatible vs incompatible users
- **Solution**: Switched to L2 normalization per individual user
- **Result**: Realistic 47-65% compatibility range achieved

**2. Feature Vector Dimensionality Issues**
- **Problem**: Inconsistent feature dimensions across users
- **Impact**: Vector length mismatches caused similarity calculation failures
- **Solution**: Standardized 101-dimensional feature vectors for all users
- **Result**: Consistent, reliable similarity computations

**3. Single Metric Limitations**
- **Problem**: Cosine similarity alone oversimplified music taste comparison
- **Impact**: Missed important aspects like artist overlap and genre preferences
- **Solution**: Multi-modal approach with weighted combination
- **Result**: Audio (45%) + Artists (35%) + Genres (20%) = comprehensive analysis

### Current Limitations
- **Dataset Size**: Limited to 3 test users for validation
- **API Access**: Using demo datasets vs. live Spotify data
- **Sample Bias**: Small, homogeneous user group

### Ethical Considerations
